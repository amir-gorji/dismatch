# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [2.6.0] - 2026-05-16

### Changed

- **`matchWithDefault` and `matchWithDefaultAsync` — `Default` now receives the triggering item** — `Default` is called with the full union value as its first argument (`item: T`), giving callers access to both the discriminant and any data fields. Previously `Default` received no arguments. `Default: () => fallback` (no declared parameters) continues to compile and work without change — TypeScript allows ignoring declared parameters.
- **Payload callers: `Default` signature shifted** — when a `Payload` generic is in use, `Default` now receives `(item, payload)` instead of `(payload)`. This is a breaking change for the small subset of callers that pass a payload and handle `Default`.
- **Build target bumped to `es2022`** — `tsup.config.ts` now targets ES2022 (was ES2020), enabling native output for features like class static blocks and `at()`.

### Fixed

- `MatcherWithDefault.Default` and `AsyncMatcherWithDefault.Default` type signatures updated — `Default` is declared as `(item: T, ...payload) => Result` using the rest-parameter form, which avoids the deferred-conditional-type problem and enables full contextual typing of `item`.
- **`GroupByResult` keys are now optional** — absent variant groups were already absent at runtime; the type now reflects this. Callers accessing `groups.circle` must guard with `groups.circle?.` or a length/existence check.

### Documentation

- **Featured plain-object emission as a top-of-README strength** — `createUnion` produces plain `{ type, ... }` objects with no runtime wrappers, enabling wire serialization, clean debugging, and direct interop with `switch` / `ts-pattern`.
- **Quick Start now documents two re-export idioms** — "namespace style" (factory + `InferUnion`) and "exit-friendly style" (file-private factory; type alias derived from `ReturnType` of constructors so it has no dependency on the factory).
- **New `Removing dismatch` section** — mechanical rewrite recipe (constructor → object literal, `match(...)` → `switch`, `is(...)` → `===`) plus an incremental-adoption block showing the same value matched with `switch`, `ts-pattern`, and dismatch side-by-side.
- **Comparison table extended** — added `Adoption & interop` group with rows for plain-object output and source-level exit cost.

### Added

- **`find(items, variants, discriminant?)`** — returns the first item matching the given variant(s), narrowed to that type, or `undefined`. Non-union items silently skipped.
- **`some(items, variants, discriminant?)`** — returns `true` if any item matches the given variant(s). Supports single and multi-variant. Non-union items silently skipped.
- **`every(items, variants, discriminant?)`** — returns `true` if every item matches the given variant(s). Non-union items are silently skipped; a collection of only non-union items is treated as empty and also returns `true` (vacuous truth, consistent with `Array.prototype.every`).
- **`groupBy(items, discriminant?)`** — groups a collection by variant in one pass. Each group is narrowed to the specific variant type (`{ circle: Circle[]; rectangle: Rectangle[] }`). Non-union items silently skipped.
- **`filterMap(items, handlers, discriminant?)`** — filters and transforms in one pass. Handler returns a value to keep or `undefined` to skip. `null` is a valid kept value. Unhandled variants silently skipped. Non-union items silently skipped.
- All five ops available as standalone functions and as pipe-friendly bindings on `createPipeHandlers` and `createUnion`.
- New exported types: `FilterMapHandlers<T, Result, Discriminant>`, `GroupByResult<T, Discriminant>`.

### Bundle size

- Canonical metric (`esbuild --bundle --minify`, non-gzipped): **3,250 B (3.17 KB)** — +805 B from 2.5.0, adding five new collection operations (~161 B/op). Stays under the 4.0 KB cap.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Async union APIs across the full surface** — added `matchAsync`, `matchWithDefaultAsync`, `matchAllAsync`, `mapAsync`, `foldAsync`, and `foldWithDefaultAsync` as standalone exports, plus bound handlers-first versions on `createPipeHandlers` and `createUnion`. `matchAllAsync` dispatches collection items in parallel via `Promise.all`; `foldAsync` and `foldWithDefaultAsync` remain sequential so the accumulator threads through `await`.
- **`createUnion(schema)` default-discriminant overload** — `createUnion` can now be called with just a schema and will inject the default `'type'` discriminant automatically. The resulting factory still exposes the full bound toolkit (`is`, `match`, async helpers, `count`, `partition`, etc.) with `discriminant === 'type'`.
- **`UnknownVariantError` named export** — exhaustive matchers and folds now surface a dedicated error class when a runtime value carries a variant that no handler covers. The error includes `.variant` and `.known` for diagnostics and recovery.
- **Async/public handler-map types exported from the main entry** — `Matcher`, `MatcherWithDefault`, `Mapper`, and `MapperAll` are now re-exported from `dismatch`, alongside new async counterparts: `AsyncMatcher`, `AsyncMatcherWithDefault`, `AsyncMapper`, `AsyncFolder`, and `AsyncFolderWithDefault`.

### Changed

- `MatcherWithDefault.Default`, `Mapper`, and `MapperAll` payload signatures no longer force a synthetic `payload` parameter when `Payload` is omitted — their type-level call shapes now match the runtime curried APIs.
- README fully restructured around reusable handlers, async matching, runtime errors, and bundle-size positioning; added dedicated sections for the async surface and `UnknownVariantError`.
- **Package verification updated for the expanded public surface** — `verify-package.mjs` now expects the async exports and `UnknownVariantError` from the main entry while continuing to assert that `dismatch/remote-data` exports *exactly* `['RemoteData']`.

### Fixed

- **Unknown runtime variants now fail with actionable diagnostics** — sync and async exhaustive dispatch paths no longer throw the generic `'No handler'` error. They now throw `UnknownVariantError` with the actual variant name, the registered handler keys, and cleaned stack traces that point at the public caller instead of internal `dispatch`/`reduce` helpers.

### Bundle size

- Canonical metric (`esbuild --bundle --minify`, non-gzipped): **3,191 B (3.12 KB)** — still under the updated **4.0 KB** main-entry cap after adding the async dispatch surface and runtime error diagnostics.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **`dismatch/remote-data`** — built-in remote data module. Exports the `RemoteData<T, E>` union type (`Idle | Loading | Refreshing<T> | Ok<T> | Failed<E>`) and a `RemoteData` constructor object (`idle`, `loading`, `refreshing`, `ok`, `failed`). Importable as a standalone sub-entry-point (`import { RemoteData } from 'dismatch/remote-data'`) — zero impact on the main bundle for consumers who don't use it.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **`createPipeHandlers().foldWithDefault`** and **`createUnion().foldWithDefault`** — `foldWithDefault` is now available as a curried, handlers-first method on both `createPipeHandlers` and `createUnion`, mirroring how `fold` was already exposed. Delegates to the standalone `foldWithDefault` with no logic duplication — tree-shakable by design.

### Bundle size

- Canonical metric (`esbuild --bundle --minify`, non-gzipped): **1,926 B (1.88 KB)** — up from 1,731 B in 2.2.0 (+195 B for the `createPipeHandlers`/`createUnion` wiring).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **`foldWithDefault`** — partial single-pass aggregator over a collection of discriminated union values, with a required `Default` fallback for unhandled variants. Unlike `fold`, not every variant needs a handler — unhandled variants route to `Default`, which receives the full union item so you can inspect which variant fell through. Standalone-only in this release (not yet available on `createUnion` / `createPipeHandlers`).
- **`FolderWithDefault<T, Acc, Discriminant>`** type helper — handler map type for `foldWithDefault`. Variant handlers are optional; `Default` is required and receives the full union item `T`.

### Changed

- `fold` internally refactored to share a `reduce` helper with `foldWithDefault` — no behaviour change.
- README: added guidance notes on `Folder` and `FolderWithDefault` clarifying they are advanced-use exports; most callers get full inference without importing them.

### Fixed

- **Prototype pollution guard in `reduce` and `dispatch`** — discriminant values that match inherited `Object.prototype` properties (e.g. `toString`, `constructor`, `__proto__`) no longer resolve to those inherited methods and attempt to call them as handlers. Both helpers now use `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` before treating a lookup as a match, so such values correctly fall through to the `Default` / `fallback` handler (or throw "No handler" if none is provided). Affects `fold`, `foldWithDefault`, `match`, and `matchWithDefault`.

### Bundle size

- Canonical metric (`esbuild --bundle --minify`, non-gzipped): **1,731 B (1.69 KB)** — up from 1,660 B in 2.1.0 (+71 B net; `foldWithDefault` added 119 B, prototype-guard fix saved 48 B).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **`count` and `partition` now skip non-union items** instead of throwing. Nulls, primitives, and plain objects lacking the discriminant property are silently ignored and do not appear in the count or either half of the partition tuple. This makes both functions safe to call on mixed or unvalidated arrays.
- **`count` uses a `Set` for variant lookup** (was `Array.includes`), giving O(1) membership checks when matching multiple variants.
- `matchWithDefault` and `MatcherWithDefault` — added a prominent JSDoc note clarifying that `Default` does not receive the triggering variant and has no way to inspect which one fell through.
- `UnionFactory._union` — annotated as a phantom/type-level-only property; accessing it at runtime returns `undefined`.

### Package

- Added `"engines": { "node": ">=18" }` to `package.json`.
- Removed the explicit `"types": ["vitest/globals"]` compiler option from `tsconfig.json`.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-12

### Changed

- Inlined `toArray` and `hasVariant` helpers — eliminated two internal functions, reducing indirection and enabling better minification.
- Extracted shared `DEFAULT_DISCRIMINANT` constant so the `'type'` string literal appears once in the bundle instead of at every call site.
- Simplified `createPipeHandlers` curried methods — replaced variadic rest-parameter spread (`...inputs`) with conditional rest params (`[Payload] extends [never] ? [] : [payload: Payload]`), enforcing payload is required when `Payload` isn't `never`.
- Replaced `hasVariant` call in `createPipeHandlers().is` with the public `is()` function.
- Removed `Object.freeze` on `createUnion().variants` array — unnecessary runtime cost with no safety benefit since the type is already `ReadonlyArray`.

### Bundle size

- Canonical metric (`esbuild --bundle --minify`, non-gzipped): **1,602 B (1.56 KB)** — down from 1,713 B in 2.0.0 (−111 B / −6.5%).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- `count(items, variant | variants, discriminant?)` — single-pass tally of how many items in a collection match the given variant(s). No intermediate array allocation.
- `partition(items, variant | variants, discriminant?)` — splits a collection into `[matched, rest]` in one pass with fully narrowed tuple types. Accepts a single variant or an array.
- **Value-first multi-variant `is()`:** `is(value, ['a', 'b'])` — narrows to a sub-union inside `if` blocks. Supports a custom discriminant via the trailing argument (e.g. `is(value, ['click','keydown'], 'kind')`).
- **`createPipeHandlers(...).is(...)`** — variant-first curried type guard, returns `(input) => input is Extract<...>`. Binds the union type and discriminant at factory construction, so `.filter(ops.is('circle'))` narrows to `Circle[]` with zero call-site generics.
- `createPipeHandlers().count` and `createPipeHandlers().partition` curried bound forms.
- `createUnion().count` and `createUnion().partition` (via `createPipeHandlers`).
- `count` and `partition` test suites; new `is()` disambiguation regression tests.
- Test files are now type-checked under `tsc --noEmit` (removed from `tsconfig.json` exclude list) so future test-side type drift is caught at the release gate.

### Removed (BREAKING)

- **`narrow` export removed.** Use `is(value, ['a','b'])` directly, or `ops.is(['a','b'])` for predicate-factory use.
- `createUnion().narrow(...)` (inherited from `createPipeHandlers`) — use `is(value, ['a','b'])`.
- `UnionFactory.narrow` type removed from public types.
- **`createUnion().is.<variant>` per-variant bound guards removed.** `createUnion().is` is now the curried predicate-factory form inherited from `createPipeHandlers` — `Shape.is('circle')` returns `(input) => input is Circle`. `createUnion().isKnown(...)` stays — it remains uniquely schema-aware.
- `UnionFactory.is` rewritten in `types.ts` from a per-variant object to the curried predicate-factory signature.

Migration:

- `narrow(v, ['a','b'])` → `is(v, ['a','b'])`
- `items.filter(narrow(['a','b']))` → `const ops = createPipeHandlers<T>('type'); items.filter(ops.is(['a','b']))`
- `shapes.filter(narrow(['circle','rect']))` → `shapes.filter(ops.is(['circle','rect']))`
- `Shape.is.circle(x)` → `is(x, 'circle')` (narrowing) or `Shape.is('circle')(x)` (curried bound form).
- `shapes.filter(Shape.is.circle)` → `shapes.filter(Shape.is('circle'))`.
- Value-first forms are unchanged: `is(value, 'circle')`, `is(value, ['circle','rectangle'])`, `is(value, 'click', 'kind')`.

### Changed

- Standalone `is()` collapsed to 2 typed value-first overloads plus an untyped fallback — no runtime arity-based disambiguation. `is(value, 'circle')` (arity 2 with two strings) is unambiguously **value-first**: first arg is the value, second is the variant name. Custom discriminant is the optional third arg: `is(value, 'circle', 'kind')`.
- `hasVariant` helper tightened to accept `string | readonly string[]` directly — eliminates per-call allocation on the single-variant hot path (previously wrapped via `toArray`).
- `UnionFactory.count` and `UnionFactory.partition` types are curried (`(variants) => (items) => result`) to match the runtime spread from `createPipeHandlers`.
- `partition` widened to accept a single variant or an array, mirroring `count`.
- Internal refactor for bundle size: `clearStackTrace` helper inlined into a single `fail` helper; `guard()` double-curry replaced with direct `ensureUnion` checks; `match` / `matchWithDefault` / `map` / `mapAll` simplified; `toArray` helper shared by `count` / `partition`.
- `src/helpers.ts` deleted (functionality inlined).
- README updated: `is()` is presented as the canonical guard, with new `count` / `partition` sections, expanded `is` documentation, and migration notes for `narrow` and bound guard helpers. Stale `narrow (deprecated)` TOC link removed.
- `samples/pipe-composition.ts` rebuilt to demonstrate `count`, `partition`, and the expanded `is()` API alongside the existing pipe composition story.
- `scripts/verify-package.mjs` expected-exports list updated to drop `narrow`, keeping release verification in sync with the removed public surface.

### Bundle size

- Canonical metric (`esbuild --bundle --minify`, non-gzipped): **1,713 B (1.67 KB)** — well under the 3.0 KB cap, despite adding `count`, `partition`, and the expanded `is()` surface. Removing `createUnion().is.<variant>` shed ~35 B versus the earlier 2.0.0 figure.
- Run `npm run size` to reproduce.

### Benchmarks

Hand-rolled micro-bench over 100,000 mixed-variant items × 50 iterations (`npm run bench`):

| Operation                                       | ms/op |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `count(items, 'circle')`                        | 0.76  |
| `items.filter(s => s.type === 'circle').length` | 0.60  |
| `count(items, ['circle', 'rectangle'])`         | 0.83  |
| inline filter+length, two variants              | 0.74  |
| `partition(items, 'circle')`                    | 0.69  |
| two-filter equivalent (`filter` + `filter`)     | 1.38  |

`count` is on the same order of magnitude as a hand-rolled inline filter (the small overhead comes from `Array.includes`). `partition` is roughly 2× faster than the two-filter equivalent because it only walks the array once.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- README now included in the published npm package (added to `files` in `package.json`)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- `narrow` — multi-variant type predicate that narrows a union to a sub-union of specified variants. Two calling styles: value-first for if-blocks (`narrow(value, ['ok', 'error'])`) and keys-first predicate factory for `.filter()` (`items.filter(narrow(['ok', 'error']))`). Supports custom discriminant keys.
- `fold` — exhaustive single-pass aggregator (reduce) over a collection of union values. Curried `fold(items, initial)(handlers)` with compile-time exhaustiveness checking. Each handler receives `(accumulator, variantData)` and returns the new accumulator.
- `Folder<T, Acc, Discriminant>` type helper for fold handler maps
- `narrow` and `fold` bound methods on `createUnion` factories and `createPipeHandlers` objects
- Test suites for `narrow` (17 cases) and `fold` (7 cases)

### Changed

- README updated with `narrow` and `fold` sections, examples, and comparison table entries
- Bundle size updated from ~1.4 kB to ~1.7 kB

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- `createUnion(discriminant, schema)` — single-definition factory producing constructors, per-variant type guards (`.is.<variant>`), schema-aware runtime check (`.isKnown`), and bound `match`/`matchWithDefault`/`map`/`mapAll` methods
- `InferUnion<T>` type helper — extracts the union type from a `createUnion` factory
- `samples/create-union.ts` end-to-end example
- 49 new tests covering constructors, guards, bound matchers, metadata, and edge cases

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Removed `Model` and `UnionByArray` type helpers from public exports — use `InferUnion` with `createUnion` instead, or define union types inline
- `Mapper` / `MapperAll` handler return type changed from `Omit<Data, Discriminant>` to `Omit<Data, Discriminant> & Partial<Pick<Data, Discriminant>>` — the discriminant is now optional in the return, so handlers can omit it, include it, or spread the input (e.g. `(ok) => ({ ...ok, data: transformed })`)
- README fully rewritten — `createUnion` is now the primary recommended workflow
- Updated `samples/fetch-state.ts`, `samples/notifications.ts`, `samples/pipe-composition.ts`

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-27

### Changed

- Improved tree shaking for ESM builds: `/*#__PURE__*/` annotations are now preserved so downstream bundlers (webpack, Vite) can safely eliminate unused code
- ESM output uses selective minification (identifiers + syntax only, whitespace preserved) while CJS remains fully minified
- Added AI-powered PR review workflow

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- Payload support for all `createPipeHandlers` methods (`match`, `matchWithDefault`, `map`, `mapAll`). Provide a second type argument `<Result, Payload>` to pass extra context to every handler; each handler receives it as a second argument and the returned function becomes `(input, payload) => result`.
- Optional `payload` parameter on the standalone `match`, `matchWithDefault`, `map`, and `mapAll` functions.

### Changed

- bundle size up to **988 bytes** (ESM, minified) due to payload feature additions

### Fixed

- `Matcher` type and all `createPipeHandlers` methods now use `[Payload] extends [never]` (non-distributive form) for the payload conditional. The distributive form previously collapsed to `never` when `Payload` was unspecified, making the returned function impossible to call.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-20

### Changed

- `is` and `isUnion` moved inline into `unions.ts`; `module.ts` removed
- Internal `dispatch` and `guard` helpers extracted to eliminate code duplication across `match`, `matchWithDefault`, `map`, `mapAll`, and `createPipeHandlers`
- `createPipeHandlers` now delegates to the public `match`/`matchWithDefault`/`map`/`mapAll` functions instead of duplicating logic
- `mapAll` now enforces exhaustiveness at **runtime** in addition to compile time — throws `'Matcher incomplete!'` if a handler is missing, mirroring `match` behaviour
- Minification enabled in tsup config
- bundle size down to **901 bytes** (ESM, minified)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- `createPipeHandlers<T, Discriminant>(discriminant)` — creates a handler factory bound to a discriminant key, returning `match`, `matchWithDefault`, `map`, and `mapAll` in handlers-first (pipe-friendly) order: `(handlers) => (input) => result`
- `TakeDiscriminant<T>` utility type exported from the public API
- `samples/` directory with three real-world TypeScript examples: `fetch-state.ts`, `pipe-composition.ts`, `notifications.ts`

### Changed

- `createPipeHandlers` and `TakeDiscriminant` are now exported from the main package entry point
- Removed unnecessary generic from `createPipeHandler` in README
- `Model<DiscriminantValue, Data, Discriminant>` — `Data` now defaults to `{}` and `Discriminant` defaults to `'type'`, enabling the common 1- and 2-argument forms (`Model<'idle'>`, `Model<'ok', { data: string }>`)
- README fully restructured: table of contents, complete API reference with signatures and examples, `createPipeHandlers` pipe composition guide, type helper documentation, and real-world patterns

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- MIT License

### Changed

- Discriminant generic parameter constraint widened from `string` to `string | number | symbol` across all types (`SampleUnion`, `Model`, `Matcher`, `MatcherWithDefault`, `Mapper`, `MapperAll`) and all functions (`match`, `matchWithDefault`, `map`, `mapAll`, `is`, `isUnion`)
- `UnionByArray` utility type updated to accept `string | number | symbol` discriminant
- New internal `TakeDiscriminant` utility type added to `types.ts`
- Improved tree shaking via updated package exports and `tsup` build config
- README improvements

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- Customizable discriminant property name across all APIs (`match`, `matchWithDefault`, `map`, `mapAll`, `is`, `isUnion`)
- All functions now accept an optional `discriminant` parameter (defaults to `'type'` for backward compatibility)
- `Model`, `SampleUnion`, `Matcher`, `MatcherWithDefault`, `Mapper`, `MapperAll` types updated with `Discriminant` generic parameter

### Fixed

- `match()` was not passing discriminant to `isUnion()` and `Module.match()`
